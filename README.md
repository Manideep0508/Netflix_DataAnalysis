**Recommendations**

The most popular Genres across the countries and in both TV Shows and Movies are Drama, Comedy and International TV Shows/Movies, so content aligning to that is recommended.

Given the popularity of TV shows in Asian countries, particularly South Korea and Japan, Netflix should increase its investment in producing and acquiring Asian TV shows.

Given the significant investment in content production in the USA and the emphasis on India, Netflix should continue to focus on these markets.

Focusing on releasing high-quality content during the months of January, July, August, October, and December could lead to increased viewer interest and engagement as these months have historically seen higher content upload counts, indicating higher demand during those periods.

Recognizing the popularity of shorter TV series, Netflix should continue focusing on producing limited series and shorter season formats. This approach aligns with viewer preferences for consuming content in manageable episodes.

Given the trend of faster availability of TV shows compared to movies, Netflix could work on acquiring more recent movies and reducing the time lag between their theatrical release and availability on the platform. This could cater to the audience's preference for up-to-date TV shows and movies.
